# blast_for_joe
quick bit of code to run tblastn searches on a local nucleotide genome

requires python >3.7

Put genome in genome folder (fasta file).
Put queries in queries folder (fasta file).  I think you need to make sure there are no line breaks in the protein sequences.  

Run do_blast.py  

Results appear in results folder.
